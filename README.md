# GitHub Actions Weekly

This project contains a GitHub Actions workflow that is scheduled to run once a week. The primary purpose of this workflow is to automate tasks that need to be executed on a regular basis, such as running tests, deploying applications, or performing maintenance tasks.

## Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in the file located at `.github/workflows/weekly-workflow.yml`. This file contains the necessary configuration for the scheduled trigger and the jobs that will be executed.

### Modifying the Workflow

If you need to modify the schedule or the jobs that are executed, you can do so by editing the `weekly-workflow.yml` file. The schedule is defined using cron syntax, allowing you to specify the exact timing for the workflow to run.

### Example Use Cases

- Running automated tests on a weekly basis to ensure code quality.
- Deploying updates to a staging environment for review.
- Performing regular maintenance tasks such as cleaning up resources or generating reports.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and ensure that the workflow file is correctly configured to meet your needs. You can then push changes to the repository, and the workflow will automatically run according to the defined schedule.
